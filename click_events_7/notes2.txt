// click event = An interaction when a user clicks on a specific element.
//               We can respond to a click by passing a callback to the Onclick event handler

Note--If you have more than one line code in your arrow func then you have to use curly braces

let count = 0;

    const handleClick = (name)=> {

        if(count<3){
            count++;
            console.log(`${name} you clicked me ${count} time/s`)
        }
        else{
            console.log(`${name} stop clicking me!`)
        }
    }
