The useState() is a React hook that lets you declare and manage state variables in a functional component. It returns an array containing two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value.

A hook is a special function in React that allows you to "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features within functional components, without writing a class component. Hooks start with the word "use" (e.g., useState, useEffect).
